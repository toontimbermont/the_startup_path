> Do the right things & do them right

How do you know your idea will allow you to earn your living? How do you convince other people to invest money in your venture? How do you attrackt talented collaborators to join your growing company?

Besides a (grand) vision for the future, knowing your commercial potential is a key argument to answer these questions. So for the various (iterations of) your product, you’ll need to assess the business potential. 

This can be done through the following concepts:

> [!TIP] Total Market (~ Problem Size) >> Potential Market (~ Willingness to change) >> Total Addressable Market (~ Fit with your Product)>> Expected Volume (~ Sales)

## Total Market & Potential Market
The total market is (hopefully) a large number, which you can find in market research reports that give an indication of the size of the problem or opportunity (eg. the total AI space is worth xx Billion of € by 20 something). These numbers can help you to compare different markets (or more correctly: the current buzz around these markets), but do not tell you anything about your own market. That will come later :)

The potential market adds the factor “Willingness to Change” and is linked to the market demographics. You will be a newcomer in the (total) market where factors like barriers to entry, existing contracts, … will influence how easy it is to break into this market.  

## Total Addressable Market (TAM)
Here it becomes more interesting: the TAM is the total market demand for ==your== product or service, within your [geographical] reach. 

This is the market size you need to understand, as soon as possible in a bottom-up fashion.
### TAM Calculated
> [!TIP] TAM = # Customers x Price

#### Customers
The 1st part of the equation deals with customer, triggering a few questions:

- Where are your customers? eg. Flanders, Benelux, EU, Global?
- Which (sub-) segment of the population is reachable for you product? eg. Small & Medium Sized Business within the food industry that have a legal obligation to report the CO2 consumption of their entire chain of production
- What are the assumptions behind the number of customers? eg. there are xx companies in Flanders that meet these requirements (based on the membership list of their nework organisation) that do not have internal capacity to take care of this reporting
#### Price
The second part also comes with its questions:
- How much will you charge? On which unit (time, user, customer, …)
- What are the assumptions & to what extent are these assumption be “de-risked”? The competitor’s price can be used, but only as inspiration. The real question is how much your customers are to pay
## Expected Volume
Once you have your TAM, take into account that you will only be able to capture a part of the market, depending on the competitor landscape, the product quality & the sales succes. But that is for other sections of this site.
