No company exists on an island, so you need to understand the environment in which you will operate. A few base concepts you need to master when thinking about the actual business model.

The demographics metaphore helps:
- Who is the population of target customers? What is the problem they have & want to see addressed?
- When do they become a potential customer? Which events trigger them to be open for your product or service?
- What are they willing to pay?
- What are the big trends in your target population? Is it a bunch of youngsters that want to try something new every few months? Or rather a consolidating & maturing group that wants quality & stability above all?
