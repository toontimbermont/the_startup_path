Starting a company, growing it to fruition and passing it on to ensure a long lifetime is an excercise tha can be summarised in the following formula: 

$$Success = F(Learning, Network, Capital, Time)$$

If you have previous experience (succesful or not!), you will be further along your learning journey and probably built you a network of some sorts. This means that youâ€™ll be able to save time and/or capital.
## List the experience you have
Hard skills like knowing to program, having the engineering skills or being a great salesperson are crucial assets in a founder team. Your education, previous work experience and trainings will likely be a rather easy source to list these skills. Futhermore, these skills can be rather quick to learn if they fit with your talents.

Soft skills like team management, stress resistance, communication and leadership are harder to identify and self assess. For these skills, rather use an external assessment (like the talent identification) to get to know yourself.
## List the experience you need, fill the gaps
Based on your business model, you can make the delta between the skills you need and the skills you have (yourself or within the founder team). 

For the skills you do not have (yet): get external input and make sure their input is of high quality. The potential impact of making good choices in the early stages of your journey is high: time will become a multiplier for good choices (and bad choices that are not corrected!).
