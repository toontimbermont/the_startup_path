## Learning
The essence of a succesful start-up and scale-up is that the rate of learning is faster than the change of the environment you operate in.

As a founder, this goes even further. As the company evolves, your role will evolve as well. From brainstorming about a business model to answering a support call, fom hiring your 1st employee to talking to banks or VCs for funding, few days will be the same. Futhermore, you’ll need to look to think ahead to make the right moves ahead. 

Learning is a key element in making this happen. So you have do discover your way of learning. Books, video’s, courses, talking to experts, … all good :) One point of advice: learning by doing is the deepest learning, but also the slowest. Make sure that this is not your only way!
## Deep work
There is a reason why XXX called his seminal book “The hard things about hard things”. Entrepreneurship is hard. Because it often means a lot of work, but also because it is difficult work. Making tough choices, solving hard problems, … 

If you choose for this journey, you will need all the potential of your brain and body. The brain part is very well described in the book “Deep Work” from Cal Newman. Just like learning, make deep work part of your mindset.
## Be OK with failure
You will encounter failure. Full. Stop.

You will do your stinking best, but still … prospects will say no, clients will be unhappy (to a certain degree), employees will leave…

You will put your time and perhaps even money in the company. It may work. But it may not. And if it does not, it may even have nothing to do with how you did as a company or founder. Context may change overnight (COVID!), you may fall ill or your co-founder can change her mind about the start-up because of reason [fill in anything that you cannot imagine at the moment].

Failure will happen. You’ll have to deal with it. Even better is you learn from it, take a deep breath and persevere.
## Perseverence
> Success if falling down 8 times and getting up 9 times

Moving on after a failure, pushing through even if there are (child) diseases in a product, finding the energy to go on if you are struggling as a solopreneur or team, … all of these are examples of the perseverence you need if you want to build your company.

Here as well it is important to know yourself! If you need someone to help you get through these dips, perhaps this is in indication that being a solopreneur is not the optimal path for you.

## Self-Care
> You cannot care for someone or something else if you do not care for yourself

Ignore all of the above if you do not take care of yourself. Healthy eating, doing sports, good sleep, … are crucial to be able to realise the items mentioned above.
