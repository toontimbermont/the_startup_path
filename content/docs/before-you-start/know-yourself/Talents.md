## Know Your Talents

Starting a startup will put pressure on you. You will (have to) learn along the way and you will be pushed out of your comfort zone.

Besides running out of money, running out of energy is the biggest risk for startup founders. Staying within your talents will prevent this from happening. So you need to know your talents, stay as much as possible within these talents and avoid exaggerating your talents.

> Talent is having a unique gift, a natural aptitude. Talent shows itself in every activity that goes effortlessly and satisfies you. When you do what you do well, time flies. And it charges your batteries. â€“ Luk Dewulf

Take some time to understand where your talents are and if entrepreneurship is in line with your talents.
