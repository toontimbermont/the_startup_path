Because starting a company will have profound impact on your life, it is worth thinking about your goals in life as well.

All of our lifes share a number of areas that are key:
- Family & Friends
- Family
- Health, Mind & Body
- Home (and garden)
- Leisure & Hobbies
- Posessions
- Personal Development
- … and Career

Before staring the journey of a start-up it is worthwhile to take some think time and go over these areas. Who do I want to be in 5 or 10 years time? What are my goals in these areas? How do I combine more private aspects (eg. having a growing family) with the professional aspirations? 

Do not expect to have all the answers and definitely do not set them in stone. Rather use this as an anchor that will help you to keep the focus on the things that are really important to you.
