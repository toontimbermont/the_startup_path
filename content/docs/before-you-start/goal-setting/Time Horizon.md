Some people advise to device an exit plan as soon as your start your venture. Albeit rather extremely put, there is a source of truth in this. Setting a time horizon is very valuable.

This time horizon creates a constraint and makes you creative in finding solutions: if you know that you only have 2 years before you want to have a sellable company, you are forced to focus and you need to find (creative) solutions to the constraint ahead of you.

If you rather have a time horizon of 25 years, your company will have a wholy different lifecycle.

One thing that will largely influence this horizon is your personality and talents: are you a person that can and want to work in one area for a long time or do you rather switch domains now and then?

Another element that will heavily influence the time horizon is the market in which you want to start. Is your personal time horizon in line with the time horizons & dynamics that are needed to conquer your position in the market? 

As a final point: setting a timeline is very valuable to create clarity around the expectations you may have towards your potential co-founders. Are you in for a lifelong journey or is it a time-bound trajectory?
