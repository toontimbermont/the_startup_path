Jules Vernon talks about a “Big Hairy Audacias Goal”, Simon Sinek urgest you to “1st ask why”… For me, the underlying reason these seamingly vague statements are so important is (i) because they allow you to make aligned decisions and (ii) because they must give you energy when things go wary (and they will).

As a candidate entrepreneur, understanding your interntal motivation will help you to make the right choices. Formulating your personal why and a matching company why is a fundamental element for you venture.

## Personal Why
Your personal why may be financial (I want to become a millionnaire), emotional (My best friend died because of … ), societal (Climate Change) or a combination. 

Very often, there is a psychological aspect in your personal why (I want to prove I am able to …, I want to influence the world …). These deeply personal motivations & convictions will have a (unconciousness) influence on how you behave, how you take decisions and where you will find energy to keep going when things go rough.

No matter what your whys are, having a good understanding of them will help you to grow personally and professionaly. Investing in uncovering your own motivation is hence a very worthwile effort.
## Company Why
For the company why, the same clarity is needed to get the benefits: easier decision taking and getting (collective) energy from it.

For the energy part, aim for an overarching and ambitious why that survives the short term.

For the decision taking benefit, I advice to add a constraint in your “why”:

Compare “Reduce carbon dioxide” vs. “Recude carbon dioxide in a way that everyone has access to it”. The latter is harder, but is much more valuable. It allows you to choose: if you have 2 solutions to reduce carbon dioxide, the 1st sentence does not give you any basis to make a choice, as there is no constraining factor. In the 2nd case, you can compare the reach of your solution. Because you want to reduce carbon dioxide in a way that everyone has access to it, the reach of both solutions can be used as a comparing measure.

Another example is “Reduce Red Tape” vs. “Maximize Red Tape Reduction with Minimal Tax Spending”. If a client wants to put a project in place to reduce red tape, but does so in a very expensive way, the constraint in the 2nd “why” will allow you to take a decision not to take part in this project.
