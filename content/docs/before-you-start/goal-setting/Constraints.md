Just like the time horizon is a constraint, other constraints are to be thought of as well.

Let me re-iterate the formula for success:

$$Success = F(Learning, Network, Capital, Time)$$

A constraint in the continuous learning domain may be that you are not talented or willing to become a “manager” of a larger company. Running a company with a headcount of 1, 5, 15 or 50+ people are fundamentally different settings; require very different skills. If you as a founder remain a leader in the company, you’ll have to evolve along. Investigating if you have a talent for become such a leader and doing some self-reflection on your willingness to learn & become one are very useful investments when thinking about the ambitions you will formulate for your start-up.

The network you have access to is another are where it is good to think about the constraints early on. Do you know people with easy access to (venture) capital? Do you have a pool of (ex-) colleagues that have the skills your company will need?

Finally, mapping out the available (personal) budget or access to such budgets that can serve a buffer is a key element in avoiding to jeapordize your personal financial situation by taking (too much) risk in your professional life.

Most of these constraints can be lifted over time. If you do not have an existing network in a specific area, you can start building one. If you have sufficient talent for analytical problem solving, you can learn to programme, and with a good enough case, you will get yourselve access to the network and capital your venture need. 

The key takeaway is to be aware of your constraints as they will take time and energy to overcome. Which will in turn impact your time horizon.
