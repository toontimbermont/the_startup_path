Each of these skills to cover requires distinct talents & knowledge. Knowledge can be built, talents much less. So match your talents with these three domains. If you have a B2B commercial role in a startup you need to get energy from connecting with a lot of people.

If you do not cover all necessary skills, find co-founders or high-potential employees that complement you.

## Going Solo(preneur)
If you are going solo, you must be sure that you are willing to cover all the responsibility needed for your venture on your own. Going solo can be liberating, but the responsibility can also be heavy to carry. 

## Founder team
If you decide to go with a founder team, 3 key element in the succes are:
- Getting along (you’ll need this when hard times arrive, and they will…)
- Taking good decisions
- Work together efficiently
### Getting Along
A large part of this requirement boils down to a subconcious feeling of connectedness and mutual understanding without a lot of words. Only trying it out can give you the answer.

More often than not, the founders will not be(come) active in the venture at exactly the same moment. If that is the case, aligning very well on things that have already been established (vision, market understanding, business model, … ) is of the utmost importance. You likely do not take a new founder on board if she does not bring new insights and experience or skills, so this could (and should?) be a moment to reflect on key hypotheses and perhaps reconsider certain decisions.

### Good Decision Taking
Which brings us to the 2nd dimension: decision taking. The best decisions are made among people with complementary skills and point of views: 2 engineers that have the same education & professional experience typically have a narrower range than an engineer and a psychologist who has a knack for empathising with potential customers.

As founder, you’ll need to be able to have constructive conflict based on mutual trust. The best decisions come from an open discussion that explores a broad solution space, highlighting the pros & cons, combining this with a healthy dose of intuïtion. 

When it comes to decision taking, having an odd number of founders can be an advantage but there is a risk of coalition-forming. So rather than focusing on the number of founders, focus on how you work as a (leadership) team.

### Work Together Efficiently
As long as you are with a small team, the majority of your time will be spent on doing actual work. So as founders, you need to be able to work together without a lot of overhead when work goes from one person to the other and back. Time will be your most important constraint, so you do not want to loose a lot of it while getting things done.

## Founder versus Early Employee
A good question to ask is whether you can you run the company with only the founders. If this is not the case, ask yourself who you need extra and why this person should not be a founder as well. If he/she lacks critical skills, this may be an indication that this person is not the right person to have as very early employee either: these early employees are the next generation of leaders and will have a huge impact on the company culture.

>[!TIP] Growth Ambitions? 
If you have growth ambitions, hire internally to build internal systems and people that can shape & run the systems
