Throughout the lifecycle of the company, the founder skills should cover fthe skills needed for the core activity of the venture. As the company grows, these key skills can also be filled in by employees or external parties.
## Core Activities
### 1st Phase (pre product-market fit)
> **Do things, do the right things, do them right**

There are a number of core activities of the venture that need to be covered as of day 1.

In these early stages, the following skills will be dearly needed:
- **Do things:** Delivery (this can involve services, content, software or even physical components) - “if you build it, people will come“ is a statement I do not believe in (see the marketing & sales parts), but it is true that you need to deliver your product or service and that this activity is likely your most important time consumer.
- **Do things right:** Domain Expertise - there are start-ups where the founders build the domain knowledge as they go and that is fine. As long as you take into account that building domain knowledge takes time and requires deep work. As you will build your business model, this is going to be a factor determining your velocity to do things right.
- **Do the right things:** Marketing - do not wait with this: getting to know the market, getting to know the potential customers and tailoring the message to them is a key element in doing the right things.

Learning & Discovery mindset, where you have to be able to deal with a “white page” and base your decisions on partial information, course correct and pivot if needed, is going to be very helpful in the 1st phase. 

Linked to that, you will need an entrepreneurial mindset, that allows you to see opportunities and recover from seeming failures. 

### 2nd Phase (after product-market fit)
> **Do things repeatadly and predictably**

Once the foundations of the company are proven, the work an attention will shift to more “operational” tasks and skills:



- Sales
- Customer (After) Care

Delivery mindset becomes more & more important
Discipline, systematic, … 
Also here, remain creative to find solutions with limited means (vs. corporate)

Think about the future as well. Soon, your startup will need you as a leader in your area. If you’re the tech founder, you must combine hard skills with people & communication skills.

### 3rd Phase (Scale)
> **Support other people doing the right things right, repeatadly and predictably**

- Managerial
- Organisational
- Interpersonal
- Communications
## Seconday Activity
Next to these, the founders will need to establish some supporting functions, of which finance is a key one.

Hire Experts & External Support ASAP
- Build internal knowledge so you can assess the external experts
- Build systems so that these experts can be replaced if needed

## Ad-Hoc Support
E.g. press contact, website design, coaching, …

## Advisory Board
Sounding board to make sure you do not miss large 

Suggestions for making the most out of advisory boards:
- Having experience in large(r) companies of venture is very valuable, but make sure to have people that have done the 1st steps as well
- Make sure you turn the advisory board in a system early on to get the most out of it and to learn for the scenario when you have a proper “board of directors”
