### System Design
System design is a powerful way to see how resources flow through a sequence of steps. Each having a possible delay (eg. the sales duration), loss (eg. attrition) and transformations along the way (from prospect to client to invoice).

This makes this way of modelling very interesting to explore your business model and ask interesting questions.

As a next step, the model can serve as a base for a quite interesting simulation. Seeing how time influences the behaviour of the eco-system in which you operate and being able to play with the parameters.
