You may have created your 1st financial model earlier in your proces, but if you have not done so yet, this is the moment to spend some time in spreadsheets.

The end result should be a simple financial model that allows you to start tracking your costs & revenues. Not to be(come) a full accounting system - hire an expert for that - but to start building your financial knowledge (continuous learning, remember!) and have a tool to identify more assumptions that underpin your business model.

## Key Questions your Financial Model must be able to answer
Keeping track of your financials is not (yet ;) to know how rich you are, but to get information about critical parameters for the health of your company:
- What is the cash runway?
- What are the assumptions underlying my revenue?
	- Which [desirability assumptions](../business-model-validation/#desirability-assumptions) are underpinning the sales numbers? How certain are these?
- Are the budgets spent in the right area to realise the feasibility assumptions? 
	- If you want to grow fast, you need to have sufficient sales & marketing efforts. 
	- If you are developing a new software product, you’ll need devs (and probably more than you think)
- What are the assumptions around viability of the business: what is the expected horizon to get the investments back?

## Key Concepts to Know
At 1st, a limited number of financial concepts will suffice:
- The revenue
	- What your customers pay. This could be invoices for project work, licenses for your software product, or sales for any physical items you sell.
- The cost of revenue (the effort or materials you need to serve your customer)
	- The costs directly related to your product or service. This can be the salaries for the consultants on your project, the customer success team that onboards & supports new customers for your software or the (raw) materials needed for the physical item you sell
- The R&D
	- The costs you incur before you can sell your product, such as the research for the innovative assets that support your consulting, the development done for the software product
- The Sales & Marketing Costs
	- The salaries of the sales & marketing department or external people and campaigns
- The General & Administrative costs
	- The offices, printers, coffee, accountants, legal, … that are needed to run your business.

Taking the revenu and decucing the 4 cost categories will give you the operating income or loss, which will in term allow you to determine your cash position.

An important element to take into account is that your cash position will be influenced by your cash cycle: how fast are you able to turn an invoice sent to your client into money on your account.
